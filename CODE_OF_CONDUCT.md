# code of conduct

this code of conduct applies to the discussions and contributions wherever repositories this is associated with. **nowhere else.**

let's keep our conversations focused on the [technical aspects](#keep-things-technical) of the project!

## recommended behaviour

 - **be kind and respectful by default.** treat everyone with the same courtesy and consideration you'd like to receive.
 - **assume good intentions.** when someone makes a mistake, let's give them the benefit of the doubt and help one another accomplish a goal.
 - **look at the contribution, not the contributor.** see a person's merit through the quality of their contribution efforts, not through any other identifier or label. (age, race, gender, identity, etc.)
 - **when we disagree, try to understand why.** resolving disagreements and differing views constructively is important during a disagreement, be it social or technical. be open-minded!

## prohibited behaviour

 - **off-topic discussions.** this space is for focused, on topic, [technical](#keep-things-technical) work only.
 - **harass, dox, bully, or exclude.** there is no tolerance for any unwarranted behaviour that makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome as a contributor.
 - **destructive behaviour** that harms this or another project.
 - **discuss the code of conduct or publicly accuse someone of violating it.** if you have a concern, discuss it [privately with a maintainer.](#reporting-violations)

## keep things technical

in the context of this code of conduct, this means that contributions and discussions should strictly relate to the project itself.

examples include, but are not limited to, project implementation, documentation, style guides, processes like testing, and tooling.

**anything politically or ideologically charged is not tolerated.** however, if it is still an _objectively correct_ contribution, do consider packaging the contribution in an _objective, non-ideological manner_ so we can clearly see the merits of your intentions. **diverse perspectives are still welcome!**

## reporting violations

contact a maintainer of the repository if you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, with adequate evidence alongside your report.

## postamble

while these aren't rules, take this document rather in the spirit in which it's intended as — a guide to make it easier for contributors to efficiently discuss and contribute to the repository.
