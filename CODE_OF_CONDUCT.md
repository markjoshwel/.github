# Code of Conduct

## Preamble

This Code of Conduct governs this code repository only. This space is strictly for on-topic and focused discussion on technical work regarding the code repository. Let's be civil.

## Standards

Examples of what you should do in the governed space(s):
- Be welcoming, considerate, respectful, friendly and patient.
- When we disagree, try to understand why. Resolving disagreements and differing views constructively is important during a disagreement, be it social or technical.
- Help one another accomplish a goal.
- See a person's merit through the quality of code written or their contribution efforts, not through any other identifier. (Age, race, ethnicity, etc.)

Examples of what you should **not** do in the governed space(s):
- Off-topic discussion of any kind, especially offensive and sensitive issues.
- Discomfort, harass, dox, antagonise or exclude another person.
- Destructive behaviour that harms this or another project.
- Discuss the Code of Conduct or publicly accuse someone of violating it.

## Postamble

While these aren't rules, take this document rather in the spirit in which it's intended as - a guide to make it easier for contributors to efficiently discuss and contribute to the repository.

Contact a contributor of the repository if you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, with _adequate_ evidence alongside your report.
